Let V be the vector space of sequences described in Example 5 of Section 1.2. Define the functions T,U:V $\rightarrow$ V by

$$\mathrm{T}(a_1,a_2,\cdots) = (a_2,a_3,\cdots) \text{ and } \mathrm{U}(a_1,a_2,\cdots) = (0,a_1,a_2,\cdots).$$

T and U are called the \textbf{left shift} and \textbf{right shift} operators on V, respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] Prove that T and U are linear.
	\item[(b)] Prove that T is onto, but not one-to-one.
	\item[(c)] Prove that U is one-to-one, but not onto.
\end{enumerate}
